### NoSQL vs SQL (short)

**SQL (relational)**
- Fixed schema, strong consistency.
- Great for complex queries and joins.

**NoSQL**
- Flexible schema, horizontal scaling.
- Often favors availability over consistency.

**Rule of thumb:** use SQL for relational data; NoSQL for high-scale or flexible schemas.
