### Regularization

- Constrain model to reduce overfitting (L1/L2, dropout, early stopping).
- Practical perspective: how Regularization is used day-to-day in modeling, data, or evaluation workflows.
- Pros/cons: strengths like simplicity or stability versus tradeoffs like bias, variance, or compute cost depending on the setting.
- Alternatives/related: common neighboring concepts or replacement approaches that solve similar problems in different ways.
