### What kind of language is Ruby/JavaScript? (short)

**Ruby**
- Dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented.
- Strongly typed (no implicit type coercion without methods).

**JavaScript**
- Dynamic, interpreted/JIT, prototype-based.
- Weakly typed (implicit coercion is common).

**Rule of thumb:** both are dynamic; Ruby is class-based, JS is prototype-based.
