TDD (Test-Driven Development) is a way of writing software where tests come first.

In short:

Write a test that describes a small piece of desired behavior (it fails).

Write the simplest code to make the test pass.

Refactor the code while keeping all tests passing.

This cycle is often called Red → Green → Refactor.

Why use TDD?

✔️ Fewer bugs

✔️ Cleaner, better-designed code

✔️ Safe refactoring

✔️ Tests double as documentation

One-line summary:

“Define behavior with tests first, then implement only what’s needed.”
