### Generative vs discriminative

- Generative models learn p(x, y) or p(x); discriminative models learn p(y | x) or a decision boundary.
- Practical perspective: how Generative vs discriminative is used day-to-day in modeling, data, or evaluation workflows.
- Pros/cons: strengths like simplicity or stability versus tradeoffs like bias, variance, or compute cost depending on the setting.
- Alternatives/related: common neighboring concepts or replacement approaches that solve similar problems in different ways.
