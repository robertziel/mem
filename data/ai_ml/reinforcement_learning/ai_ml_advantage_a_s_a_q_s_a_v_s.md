### Advantage (A(s, a) = Q(s, a) − V(s))

- How much better action is than average at state.
- Practical perspective: how Advantage (A(s, a) = Q(s, a) − V(s)) is used day-to-day in modeling, data, or evaluation workflows.
- Pros/cons: strengths like simplicity or stability versus tradeoffs like bias, variance, or compute cost depending on the setting.
- Alternatives/related: common neighboring concepts or replacement approaches that solve similar problems in different ways.
