### DDD (Domain-Driven Design) (short)

**Goal:** model software around the business domain.

**Key ideas:**
- Ubiquitous language shared by devs + stakeholders.
- Bounded contexts to isolate models.
- Aggregates and entities to define consistency boundaries.

**Rule of thumb:** align code structure with business concepts.
