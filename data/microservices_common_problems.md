### Common microservices problems (short)

- Distributed tracing and debugging complexity.
- Network latency and partial failures.
- Data consistency across services.
- Versioning and backward compatibility.
- Operational overhead (deployments, monitoring).

**Rule of thumb:** don’t split too early; keep boundaries clear and observable.
