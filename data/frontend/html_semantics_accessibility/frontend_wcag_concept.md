### WCAG (Concept)

WCAG is the standard for accessible web content (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).

- **Key point** -> A, AA, AAA are conformance levels.
- **Key point** -> AA is the typical target.
- **Gotcha** -> WCAG is about outcomes, not just checklists.

Example:
```text
POUR: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
```
