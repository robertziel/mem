### HTTP Headers

Headers carry metadata with requests and responses.

- **Key point** -> Request headers: `Accept`, `Authorization`.
- **Key point** -> Response headers: `Content-Type`, `Cache-Control`.
- **Gotcha** -> Large headers can slow requests.

Example:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
