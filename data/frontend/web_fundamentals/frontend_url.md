### URL

A URL identifies the location of a resource on the web.

- **Key point** -> Scheme, host, path, query, fragment.
- **Key point** -> Query strings carry parameters.
- **Gotcha** -> Fragments are client-side only (not sent to server).

Example:
```text
https://example.com/products?id=123#reviews
```
