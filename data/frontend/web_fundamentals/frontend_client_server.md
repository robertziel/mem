### Client vs Server

Clients request resources; servers respond with data or pages.

- **Key point** -> Client renders UI and handles interactions.
- **Key point** -> Server handles data, auth, business logic.
- **Gotcha** -> Heavy client logic can bloat bundles.

Example:
```text
Browser -> API -> Database
```
