### OAuth (Concept)

OAuth lets apps access resources on behalf of a user without sharing passwords.

- **Key point** -> Access tokens represent delegated permission.
- **Key point** -> Use Authorization Code + PKCE for SPAs.
- **Gotcha** -> OAuth is authorization, not authentication.

Example:
```text
User -> Authorize -> Code -> Token
```
