### Positioning

Positioning changes how elements are placed relative to the normal flow.

- **Key point** -> `relative` keeps space, `absolute` removes from flow.
- **Key point** -> `fixed` is relative to the viewport.
- **Gotcha** -> `sticky` needs a scroll container to work.

Example:
```css
.header { position: sticky; top: 0; }
```
