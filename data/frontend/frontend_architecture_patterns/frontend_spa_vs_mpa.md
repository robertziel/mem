### SPA vs MPA

SPA: one HTML shell with client routing; MPA: multiple pages served by server routes.

- **Key point** -> SPA can feel faster after initial load.
- **Key point** -> MPA has simpler SSR/SEO and less JS.
- **Gotcha** -> SPAs can have heavier initial bundle.

Example:
```text
SPA: /index.html + client router
MPA: /products.html, /about.html
```
