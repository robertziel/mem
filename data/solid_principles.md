### SOLID (short)

- **S — Single Responsibility**: one reason to change.
- **O — Open/Closed**: open for extension, closed for modification.
- **L — Liskov Substitution**: subclasses can replace base classes without breaking behavior.
- **I — Interface Segregation**: small, focused interfaces.
- **D — Dependency Inversion**: depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

**Rule of thumb:** SOLID aims to reduce coupling and make code easier to change.
